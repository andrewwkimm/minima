I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Elevance Health. Before that,
I was a Data Engineer at Hero Digital, my first engineering role. I originally
started out as an analyst at Analytic Partners but found that I was much more
fulfilled building tools leading me to go into software; I've not regretted
this decision since then.

Throughout my life, though, I've held more jobs than I can count. Things I've 
done in the past that pop up in my mind are stocking shelves in various retail
stores, a barrista in cafes and bakeries, prepping meals in my college campus,
performing Korean-English interpretation for the Administration for Children's
Services, to even working in internal construction where I've flirted with
numerous opportunities for fatal injuries.
