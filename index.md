I'm Andrew Kim, a New Yorker born and raised in Queens where I've spent most of my life. 
Shortly after I was born, I was sent to temporarily live with my uncle and grandmother 
in the suburbs of Daegu, South Korea before returning back to the states for elementary 
school.

I am best reached through [email](andrewkimka@gmail.com).
